# PunkFusion

ðŸš§ **Project Status:** Under Construction ðŸš§

### Project Introduction

PunkFusion is a cutting-edge demo that combines the world of NFTs with the latest in generative AI technology. Drawing inspiration from the iconic CryptoPunks, this project leverages a vast dataset of punk-style images to explore new possibilities at the intersection of digital art and AI. Our goal is to push the boundaries of NFT creation and generative modeling, showcasing how these two technologies can be fused to create unique and innovative digital assets.

### To-Do List:
- [x] Add Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- [ ] Integrate Multi-Modality
- [ ] Implement Classifier Guidance and CFG (Class-Factorized Guidance)
- [ ] Incorporate Huber Loss
- [ ] Add DiT (Diffusion Transformer)
- [ ] Integrate RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding)
- [ ] Implement Flow Matching

### Project Overview

I am actively applying various techniques to enhance the performance of PunkFusion. Below is a sample result after training for 100 epochs:
